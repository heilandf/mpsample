# mpsample
Sample for MP API use

## Getting Started

To have this project running on your environment, just clone the repo. Use the recommended gradlew.
In case the project could not detect the SDK version, you can run Build -> Make Project.

## Deployment

You can not deploy this without a sign in config. You can just run a debug flavour, 
until you add your own keystore with your digital signature.
